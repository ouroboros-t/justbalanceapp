//NOTHING BUT IDEAS GO HERE:

//eventually want to enable a filter function so they can filter by id or by date added or by amount

//we want to be able to edit instead

//maybe add bottom navigation menu so adding can be in a cleaner place...

//we need to go back and learn how to display doubles and format the edit text properly to display the right number..
        //work on edit text insert the correct number to database
        //work on formatting the number that's retreived from the database
