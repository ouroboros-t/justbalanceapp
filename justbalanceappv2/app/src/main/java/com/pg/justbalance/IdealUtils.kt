//NOTHING BUT IDEAS GO HERE:

//---------------------------------TO DO--------------------------------


//eventually want to enable a filter function so they can filter by id or by date added or by amount
//we want to be able to edit instead
//upon click, allow items to be editable..change name, and starting amount
//alert dialog for changing an amount: "This will change the starting amount of your balance. Did you want to report a payment instead?"
        //report payment -> nav to report payment screen, no -> make starting amount editable

//splash screen!
//recyclerview component to show most recent payments/all "payments"

//button to record a payment
//need to model a payment?
    --do I need to change the database to save payments or establish a new database that saves payments only with the same balanceId..?
    //payment id would be the same as the balanceId, and there could be multiple payments per balanceId...
    //Ik how to set one up using PostgreSQL but I'm not sure about Room...




//---------------------------------DONE----------------------------------
//make list items clickable so that clicking on the pencil icon allows them to edit the entry
//total balance textview
//maybe add bottom navigation menu so adding can be in a cleaner place...

//we need to go back and learn how to display doubles and format the edit text properly to display the right number..
//work on edit text insert the correct number to database
//work on formatting the number that's retreived from the database


//TROUBLE SHOOT:
after adding an amount and navigation to balances screen, cannot navigate to add a balance screen again..
